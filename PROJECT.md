# Project

What do we want to do?

* Show off Django and some of the more important extensions
* Give examples on asynchronous communications with a frontend service
* Be useful
* Utilize toolchains for different targets such as Android and OS native UIs.

## Hrmâ€¦

How about a simple pantry inventory system?! 

## Requirements Gathering

What will our users expect in a system like this?

* Up-to-date inventory data
* The ability to easily add new items
* Contextual awareness (The particular brand of black beans may not be important)

### Our Stack

* Django will be our primary engine. It will handle practically every data transaction that takes place.

* We will want a production-worthy backend database

* We will want access to this application outside of the network

### Gits and Shiggles

> Stuff that I just want to learn better

* We want to utilize bidirectional asynchronous communications via web sockets

* We want a reasonably dynamic inventory system

* We want to gather usage data in order to (quite unnecessarily) push it through a machine learning pipeline
